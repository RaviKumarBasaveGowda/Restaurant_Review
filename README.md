#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview:

This is a simple web application which gives a user the option to select a restaurant from a list and read their reviews.

### Stage 1

In Stage 1, we use the MapBox to create a public token that will be used in our application to add Maps.

### Stage 2

In Stage 2, we have Converted the Static content to dynamic so that it works on different screen size.
This is done using the viewport tag, also replacing the static px content with the % content

### Stage 3

In Stage 3, we have worked on re ordering of the Tab Order and also added the ARIA features

### Stage 4

In Stage 4, we have added the caching capabilities to ensure the application works fine even when offline.
